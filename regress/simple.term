[1;91m[0m[1;91mAn h1 header[0m

    Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

    2nd paragraph. [3mItalic[0m, [1mbold[0m, and [1;94mmonospace[0m. Itemized lists look like:

    [93m  ¬∑ [0mthis one 
    [93m  ¬∑ [0mthat one 
    [93m  ¬∑ [0mthe other one 

    Note that ‚Äî not considering the asterisk ‚Äî the actual text content
    starts at 4-columns in.

    [93m  | [0mBlock quotes are written like so.
    [93m  | [0m
    [93m  | [0mThey can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.

    Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., ‚Äúit‚Äôs all
    in chapters 12‚Äì14‚Äù). Three dots ‚Ä¶ will be converted to an ellipsis.
    Unicode is supported. ‚ò∫

[1;36m## [0m[1;36mAn h2 header[0m

    Here‚Äôs a numbered list:

    [93m 1. [0mfirst item 
    [93m 2. [0msecond item 
    [93m 3. [0mthird item 

    Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
    from the left side). Here‚Äôs a code sample:

    [1;94m  | [0m[1m# Let me re-iterate ...[0m
    [1;94m  | [0m[1mfor i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }[0m

    As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
    indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

    [1;94m  | [0m[1mdefine foobar() {[0m
    [1;94m  | [0m[1m    print "Welcome to flavor country!";[0m
    [1;94m  | [0m[1m}[0m

    (which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
    delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

    [1;94m  | [0m[1mimport time[0m
    [1;94m  | [0m[1m# Quick, count to ten![0m
    [1;94m  | [0m[1mfor i in range(10):[0m
    [1;94m  | [0m[1m    # (but not *too* quick)[0m
    [1;94m  | [0m[1m    time.sleep(0.5)[0m
    [1;94m  | [0m[1m    print i[0m

    Now a nested list:

    [93m 1. [0mFirst, get these ingredients:
        
        [93m  ¬∑ [0mcarrots 
        [93m  ¬∑ [0mcelery 
        [93m  ¬∑ [0mlentils 
    
    [93m 2. [0mBoil some water.
    
    [93m 3. [0mDump everything in the pot and follow this algorithm:
        
        [1;94m  | [0m[1mfind wooden spoon[0m

        Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

    Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
    that last line which continues item 3 above).

    Here‚Äôs a link to [1;93ma website[0m [4;32mhttp://foo.bar[0m, to a [1;93mlocal doc[0m [0m

    A horizontal rule follows.

    Here‚Äôs a definition list:

    apples
    [93m  : [0mGood for making applesauce. 
    
    oranges
    [93m  : [0mCitrus! 
    
    tomatoes
    [93m  : [0mThere‚Äôs no ‚Äúe‚Äù in tomatoe. 

    Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
    term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

    Images can be specified like so:

    [1;93mexample image[0m [37m[Image: [0m[4;32mexample-image.jpg[0m[37m][0m

    And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
    which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: `foo`, *bar*, etc.
